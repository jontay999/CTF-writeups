# backdoorCTF 2021

<em>25th Dec 2021</em>

A jeopardy-style CTF organized by SDSLabs and InfosecIITR at [backdoor](https://backdoor.sdslabs.co/).

Did not have much time to try the CTF during the challenge during Christmas, but managed to crack one challenge that I thought was quite interesting. The challenges that I had a cursory look over seemed quite hard above my level though haha and very few people managed to crack the challenges.

The results was 36th place out of 123 participants (who achieved points).
