<em>5th - 6th Feb 2022 </em>

Organised by [Dice Gang](https://dicega.ng/)

The challenges were really tough and although I didn't find the solution for the crypto in the end. Somebody in the team I was playing with managed to get it and I wanted to do a writeup to understand it a bit better.

Placed 226th place out of 1127 teams.
