# Insane Bolt Writeup

### **TLDR**

Connect to instance, take in input as a grid, run BFS to get shortest paths, and send to standard input.
<br /><br />

## Initial

When we connect to the Docker Instance, we are given two options.

![Starting Prompt](./images/1.png)

It is a command line game where you have to input the shortest path for the ðŸ¤– to reach ðŸ’Ž via instructions DLR (Down, Left, Right). For some reason Up was not needed in this game.

![Basic Idea](./images/3.png)

From the grid given, it can be seen that the valid path always passes through a ðŸ”© at every step

<br /><br />

## First Try

At first, I thought I could slowly play the game but after a while I realised this was not meant to be brute-forced played normally.

There is a time limit, approximately 10-15 seconds, that if exceeded, would end the game. One mistake and the game would end as well. There are also a minimum of 500 levels to be completed which requires scripting

<br /><br />

## Main Idea

The problem was a classic shortest path problem which could be solved via Breadth First Search.

The main steps were to

- Connect to the Docker instance provided
- Transform the command line output and parse into a matrix
- Make the BFS function that would output the shortest path
- Send the Shortest Path as input

Code is in insane-bolts.py

## Tools Used

- `pexpect` module from python to read and write to standard input and ouput.
- `nc` command to connect to instance

  <br />

## Success

After collecting 500 diamonds, the final flag was outputted.

## Thoughts

- I didn't have much problem coming up with the BFS solution but the real problem I had was trying to run commands using the python script
- I tried using `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` to read and write but they were blocking each other (I didn't know how to interchange between reading and writing)
- After doing some research to find a way to read and write in a non-blocking manner I found the `pexpect` module which could fit my use case
- Was quite a fun problem that required a bit of knowledge of graph traversal algorithms
