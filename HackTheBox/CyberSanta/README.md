# Cyber Santa is Coming to Town!

<em>1st Dec 2021 - 5th Dec 2021 </em>

This was quite a fun CTF but was quite tiring as new challenges would be released every day, 1 challenge for each category : Forensics, Cryptography, Web, Pwn, and Reversing.

This was an individual competition and I managed to place 159th out of 7996 teams after the 5 day competition.

I really learnt a lot especially in the Pwn and Reversing challenges which I was very new to. Was glad to be able to solve 2 Pwn and 2 Reversing challenges during the competition.
