# KnightCTF

<em>10th Dec 2021 - 12th Dec 2021 </em>

Organised by [Knight Squad](https://knightsquad.org/)

There were a few problems with the infra but the challenges were quite manageable. Would probably have done better with a larger team because there were a lot of challenges and it was a busy day for the team, like 65...

Since many of the solutions are of just one exploit, I will be combining the relevant writeups done into each category

The categories that I tried were Reversing, Crypto, OSINT, Web, Misc and Stego.

Placed: 124th out of 752 teams (that scored points)
