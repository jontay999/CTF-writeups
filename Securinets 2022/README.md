# Securinets Qualifiers and Finals 2022

### Qualifiers

<em>9th April - 10th April</em>

### Finals

<em>11th May</em>

I played with Social Engineering Experts, and we managed to secure 4th place for the qualifiers and finals. The finals were on-site in Tunisia, but we just played from online, which didn't allow us to qualify for prizes.

I learnt quite a bit from some of the crypto challenges that I solved, particularly my first use of LLL.
