Basically guess suit + number correctly a sufficient amount of times to win. You have 3000 tries to try and get a score of 2000.

This can be solved by simply examining the distribution of random results mod 13

```python
import secrets

def rand_range(rng):
    return rng - (secrets.randbits(4) % rng)

d = {}
for i in range(100000):
    res = rand_range(13)
    c = d.get(res, 0)
    d[res] = c+1

print(d)

```

Which gives a heavy distribution weighted towards 11, 12, and 13

```
{4: 6186, 12: 12621, 3: 6269, 2: 6155, 8: 6287, 1: 6288, 13: 12509, 11: 12534, 10: 6225, 6: 6332, 5: 6299, 7: 6101, 9: 6194}
```

So we just guess any suit, and either 11,12, and 13, and get the flag
